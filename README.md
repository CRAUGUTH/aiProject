# Music Organizer Overview

# Initial Proposal:
The problem that I am trying to solve with this program is organizing a large amount of music into several playlists. My reasoning for this is that I, like many others, enjoy many different types of music of all different genres and vibes, which can make it very hard to organize as there are so many factors of a song to consider. An example of this would be if I have music of two different genres but that have the same vibe, or music of two different vibes but the same genre, how should I go about organizing them. Typically this would lead to me attempting to make some playlists then getting overwhelmed and flustered to the point where I just give up. In order to combat this, the program will evaluate each some, and then group the songs together based on their stats within each category. This then would result in a playlist that all flows together and can be played on shuffle without there being a dramatic change in music half way through. 
How I would go about implementing this is first, similar to my first choice, is that I would find a model which is able to evaluate music and break it down into different statistics. Then based on how many statistics I decide to have for each song, let's say 10, I would then graph the songs in a 10D space which could then be divided into how many playlists we would like. The program would do this by prompting the user for stats they want for the songs to share and then how many playlists would be created where the songs would then be sorted by those stats and then divided into several groups. The program could then also create a playlist given certain “tags”  so if you want sad pop songs it could pull all the songs that are considered both sad and pop. This could also be implemented via simply applying filters to a database in order to create a playlist with certain “tags”. What method I end up going with would probably be determined by the tools already created, whichever is easier to implement. 

# Progress Report 1:
Much of my time so far has been spent figuring out how to use the different tools I discussed in my project proposal. First of all I have been watching videos and reading articles about how to not only find ML models on HuggingFace but then also use them for your own project. Next I began researching the Spotify API in order to get a better understanding of how to get a database of music to reference from. With this research being done I figured I would go with my method of applying filters to a database in order to generate certain playlists. This I figured would be much easier with my experience in my Databases class and not having to figure out how to graph these attributes in a multi-dimensional space. Now I am beginning to look more into how to connect the Spotify API to the ML algorithm in order to pull songs from the Spotify database that I would like to classify. After that I plan on creating some sort of data structure myself in which I will store each song with their classification.
Once I have figured out how to do that I will need to figure out how I would want the playlist creation to go as I am not sure how I want to go about doing that as I am stuck between two options. First organize each song into a non-distinct playlists, such that some songs may appear in multiple playlists. Or second if I should ask the user for attributes in which it then pulls songs and creates a playlist which follows those tags. I am leaning more towards the second option but I am going to have to figure out how to match keywords with the tag on the actual songs.
